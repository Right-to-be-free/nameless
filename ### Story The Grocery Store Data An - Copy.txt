### Story: The Grocery Store Data Analytics Team

At **FreshMart Grocery**, the data analytics team is tasked with optimizing store operations and improving the customer experience. Using mathematical and programming concepts, they analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management. Here’s how they do it:

---

### **1. Bernoulli Distribution: Will a Customer Buy?**

The team models whether a customer will purchase a specific product (e.g., organic apples) using the **Bernoulli distribution**. Each customer's decision is binary: either they buy the product (1) or they don’t (0). 

- **Example:** Based on past data, the probability of a customer buying organic apples is $$ p = 0.4 $$. Using this, they estimate:
  $$
  P(\text{Buy}) = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad P(\text{No Buy}) = 0.6
  $$

This helps the store predict demand for specific items.

---

### **2. Binomial Distribution: Predicting Sales**

To predict total sales of organic apples in a day, the team uses the **Binomial distribution**, which extends the Bernoulli distribution to multiple trials.

- **Example:** If 100 customers visit the store daily and each has a 40% chance of buying organic apples, the expected number of sales can be calculated as:
  $$
  X \sim Binomial(n=100, p=0.4)
  $$

This helps FreshMart stock an appropriate number of organic apples.

### **3. Normal Distribution: Daily Milk Sales**

The team observes that daily milk sales follow a **Normal distribution** with a mean ($$ \mu $$) of 200 gallons and a standard deviation ($$ \sigma $$) of 20 gallons. They use this to predict sales and manage inventory.

- **Example:** Using the normal distribution formula:
  $$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  $$
They calculate that approximately 68% of days will have milk sales between $$180$$ and $$220$$ gallons ($$ \mu \pm \sigma $$).

### **4. Mean, Median, and Mode: Summarizing Data**

The team uses these measures to summarize sales data:
- **Mean**: The average daily revenue is $5,000.
- **Median**: The middle revenue value over a month is $4,800.
- **Mode**: The most frequent revenue value is $4,500.

These insights help identify trends and outliers in sales performance.

### **5. Vector Spaces: Customer Preferences**

Each customer’s preferences are represented as a vector:
$$
\mathbf{v} = (\text{Fruits}, \text{Vegetables}, \text{Snacks}, \text{Dairy})
$$
The team uses vector spaces to analyze relationships between product categories. For instance, customers who buy fruits often also buy dairy products.

- **Scalar Multiplication Example:** During a promotion, preferences for snacks are scaled up by a factor of $$1.5$$, resulting in:
$$
\mathbf{v}_{\text{new}} = (Fruits, Vegetables, 1.5 \cdot Snacks, Dairy)
$$

### **6. Eigenvectors: Stable Shopping Patterns**

The team studies shopping patterns using eigenvectors. For example, they find that certain combinations of products (e.g., bread and milk) are consistently purchased together regardless of promotions or seasons.

---

### **7. Python File Read/Write for Data Analysis**

The team uses Python to manage sales data:
- **Reading Data**: They load daily sales records from a CSV file.
```python
import pandas as pd
sales_data = pd.read_csv('daily_sales.csv')
```
- **Writing Data**: After analysis, they save insights to a new file.
```python
sales_data.to_csv('sales_insights.csv', index=False)
```

---

### **8. Arrays and Sets for Inventory Management**

- The team uses arrays to store quantities of items in stock:
```python
import numpy as np
inventory = np.array([50, 30, 20])  # [Milk, Bread, Eggs]
```
- They use sets to track unique customers who used loyalty cards:
```python
customers_today = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
customers_yesterday = {"Alice", "David"}
unique_customers = customers_today.union(customers_yesterday)
```

---

### **9. Arguments in Real Life: Pricing Debate**

During pricing strategy meetings, the marketing team debates whether to lower prices for dairy products:
- Argument *for*: Lower prices could increase demand (based on Bernoulli trials).
- Argument *against*: Reduced margins might hurt profitability.

Using their models (e.g., binomial and normal distributions), the analytics team provides data-driven recommendations.

---

### **Conclusion**

By applying these concepts:
1. FreshMart predicts customer behavior with Bernoulli and binomial distributions.
2. Inventory is managed efficiently using normal distributions.
3. Insights from mean, median, mode, vector spaces, and eigenvectors improve operations.
4. Python automates data handling for faster decision-making.

This data-driven approach ensures FreshMart stays competitive while offering customers an excellent shopping experience!
