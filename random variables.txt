A random variable is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events.
ex- data from senses, Sports scores, and scientific experiments.

A variable is a characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted, such as a phone number, address, or date of birth.

A discrete variable is a variable that takes on distinct, countable values
ex-name, age, location.

A continuous variable is a variable that can take on an infinite number of values within a range ex- gas price 3.29999, grocery bill- 211.29999, 

 
A random event is an occurrence that cannot be predicted with certainty. Although it is unpredictable, the probability of different outcomes can be calculated.
ex-lottery, ETA for a distance, experimental outcomes.
prime number

 A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainder ex- 2,5,7,11.

In mathematics, a "sample space" refers to the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, essentially listing every potential result that could occur in a given situation

In mathematics, an "outcome" refers to a possible result of an experiment or trial, essentially meaning any single potential result that could occur when performing a probabilistic event

In mathematics, "output" refers to the result or value produced by a function after an input is processed
